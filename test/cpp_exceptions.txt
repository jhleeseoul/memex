# Understanding Exceptions in C++

Exceptions in C++ are a mechanism for handling runtime errors or unexpected conditions in a program. They provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another when an error occurs, allowing developers to write robust and maintainable code.

## Basics of Exceptions

An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program. In C++, exceptions are thrown using the `throw` keyword and caught using `try` and `catch` blocks.

### Example:
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

int main() {
    try {
        // Throwing an exception
        throw std::runtime_error("An error occurred!");
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        // Catching and handling the exception
        std::cerr << "Exception caught: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    std::cout << "Program continues after exception handling." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
